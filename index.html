        <h1>An appeal from owners of Navin's Starwood Towers</h1>
        <p>
          We, the owners of <a href="#">Navin's Starwood Towers - Phase I, Medavakkam, Chennai</a> have come together in our angst and created this web page to highlight how Navin Housing and Properties (P) Ltd - the builder have repeatedly ignored our rights and sidelined our reasonable concerns for their commercial interests. As an organization that proudly advertise the motto “The Home Makers Who Care”, their actions prove otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>The following issues have been repeatedly raised to Navin's over the past 4 years- ever since they had completed the construction of Phase I, individually by owners and by the elected Associations.</p>
        <ul class="issues">
          <li>
            <h5>Exploitation over Clubhouse - Lily of the Valley</h5>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>Navin's has collected 1.5 lakh towards Clubhouse membership and a premium rate per sft than neighbouring developers from every owner, stating the worldclass amenities in offer there. It took them over 4 years to complete the construction and public opening of this Clubhouse. Now, they demand a minimum yearly subscription of INR 10,000 from each family to use even the basic amenities provided. This is over the very high society maintenance of INR 3.5/Sft that we are being charged by them. Our repeated requests to have basic facilities like Gym, Swimming Pool and Childrens Play area free of charge is being ignored.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Unmet OSR Requirements</h5>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>Navin's has not cleared the OSR area required for such a development and are using the area allotted for storing their heavy construction equipments, free of charge. </p>
              <div class="gallery-wrapper">---- Pictures of OSR area ----</div>
            </div>
          </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Insufficient play area</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>The area provided for children to play is too less within the Apartment complex and together with the issue of no OSR provided, they have no place to play and can be seen playing in driveways and car parks, causing great discomfort to senior citizens and an accident waiting to happen.</p>
            <div class="gallery-wrapper">---- Video of kids playing ----</div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Sub-standard maintenance</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>Navins has not handed over the maintenance to the elected Association yet, stating they will only do so after they sell all the units. However, there is no timelines given to this and we are being charged much higher than many nearby complexes with similar capacity and facilities. We let you be the judge of the quality of their maintenance by taking a look at the photographs below.</p>
            <div class="gallery-wrapper">---- To place a gallery of photographs here ----</div>
            <p>Poorly maintained service toilets, unattended landscaping of podiums, poorely laid concrete blocks on driveways are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the quality of maintenance from Navins. Even after several months of promises, an Apartment community App like MyGate is not implemented, where we can record these issues and ask for accountability.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Whimsical and impractical parking space allotment</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>Many owners were not provided with the accurate blueprint of their allotted parking spots at the time of purchase. Many have expereinces of having charged for two parking lots, only to realise there is barely space to park another car. There are instances where the parking angle is so tight that it requires special driving skills to navigate without damaging your vehicle.</p>
            <div class="gallery-wrapper">---- Car park video/photos ----</div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Poor quality of construction</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>Several flats are observing leakages within a year of moving in, often caused by the poor civil work. Washrooms have poor slopes provided resulting in dry areas always wet. Many flats have AC leakages getting reported due to poor considerations in providing AC outlets. Although there is power backup, many flats face issues with inconsistant auto-switching to backup power due to bad electrical equipment used. There are simple unmet practical issues in almost every flat, and what seems like simple fixes are not being done or allowed to be done stating the limitations of Mivan construction technology.</p>
